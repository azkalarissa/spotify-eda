**Exploratory Data Analysis on Spotify Personal Data**

Spotify allows us to download our personal data including playback activity, search history, streaming history among other things in JSON format. With this data we can check our Spotify statistics before Spotify Wrapped at the end of the year. Isn't it cool?

This script contains simple exploratory data analysis based on Spotify streaming history data. This is my personal project to practice my Python skill. I've always been a big fan of music so why not giving an attempt to analyze my own music taste!

**Required**
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
